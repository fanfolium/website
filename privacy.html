If Fanfolium sells or transfers all or a portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are shared, disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction.

                        In the event of a litigious involvement, Fanfolium reserves the right to disclose personal information to help legal processes take their due courses.

                    <p>We use "cookies", or similar electronic tools for collecting information by assigning visitors non repeating random numbers/letters/special-characters sequences as User Identification (User ID) to understand each user's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies themselves (e.g., through registration), Fanfolium has no way of knowing who the user is, even if we assign a cookie to the user's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the user. A cookie cannot read data off the user’s hard drives. Fanfolium’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to  users’ browsers if the users click their ad banners- a procedure, Fanfolium does not control.
                        <br>
                        Fanfolium's web servers automatically collect limited information about users’ computers’ connections to the Internet, including their IP address, when they visit the Platform. Users’ IP addresses don’t disclose their identity or any other personal information. Fanfolium uses IP address information to provide its web pages to users in a manner that would best suit their preferences, to measure traffic within the Platform and to let advertisers know the geographic locations of Fanfolium’s visitors.

                    <p>Fanfolium contains links to other websites. Those websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Fanfolium's authority.Clicking on those links will result in abandoning Fanfolium servers and entering the servers of those websites. After leaving Fanfolium's servers, use of any information provided by the users is governed by the privacy policies of the operators of the sites the users have entered. Fanfolium takes no responsibility for the privacy practices or the contents of websites other than itself.

                    <h4>5. Security of Information</h4>
                    <p>The information gathered by Fanfolium is stored in certain databases. Those databases are stored on servers secured behind  firewalls. Those servers are inaccessible without secure passwords and relevant ID. It must be understood all the same that no matter how protected a database one creates, no security system is impregnable. We therefore cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that your information will not be hacked while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Your continuing with the website/Fanfolium must imply that you understand and agree that your information may get transferred to people you don’t intend on sharing with, even after the best effort on Fanfolium’s part at trying to prevent the same from happening. Also, anything you share on discussion portals necessarily becomes public and Fanfolium won’t try to protect the same from being used by anybody. You must have total accountability for any information you choose to share on such platforms.
                        The internet is not static. Technologies and ideas are not static. We and everyone must always be prepared to accommodate the changes that we are faced with. Therefore, Fanfolium may periodically review and change its privacy policy to incorporate any future transitions as may be considered appropriate, without any notice to you. However the information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
