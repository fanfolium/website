                    <p>
                        Contests Will be presented to participants in the form of Pools or solo games. Pools can be
                        public or private. Each pool will be a representation of a variety of games that we offer to the
                        contestants. The games are index based as well as based on stocks and crypto currencies. The
                        games are meant to test the market reading abilities of participants. Generally, the most
                        skilled at understanding the underlying sentiment of stocks/crypto or indices will come out as
                        winners. Winning isn’t random though. Every contestant gets credits based on how their
                        stocks/crypto perform or how well they anticipate the movement of prices or the indices i.e.,
                        NIFTY 50 and BANKNIFTY. We have explicitly explained the Rules of Participation for each game in
                        How to Play section.
                        <br>
                        Users can participate in the contests by paying a pre-designated amount as asked for. The
                        ‘pre-designated amount’ means and includes pre-determined platform fee for accessing Fanfolium
                        services and pre-determined participant contribution towards prize money pool. For pool
                        games(pools), the Participant with the highest aggregate points at the end of the contest shall
                        be eligible to win a prize which is disbursed out of prize money pool, as stated on the relevant
                        Pool(s) page. In case of more than one participant aggregating the same points, the prize money
                        will be distributed among them for their spot. The duration of the Pool(s) and the total number
                        of allowed participants in the Pool(s) will vary but will be declared before letting the users
                        join the Pool(s), not discounting Fanfolium’s right to change them anytime as deemed necessary.
                        <br>
                        Fanfolium offers another set of games which do not require multiple players. These games/pools
                        are called solo games (Solo). In the solo games, contestants will be awarded the Prize by
                        Fanfolium. The prizes will vary according to the time of joining and market conditions. It will
                        be within the rights of Fanfolium to continue or stop such games.
                        <br>
                        Also, Fanfolium reserves the right to change the format/duration/prize of contests or completely
                        cancel the contests as and when it finds necessary. Fanfolium shall try to send notifications
                        through emails and/or SMS communications, about any such changes, if they occur. Fanfolium,
                        however, doesn’t guarantee to always inform the participants of all those changes well in

                        information on securities/indices. Users must do a thorough research of their own from official
                        sources and/or other available sources of information. Fanfolium can’t guarantee the accuracy of

                    <h4>H. Payments</h4>
                    <p>Fanfolium doesn’t charge any fee unless a user desires to play a paid contest/game. In order to
                        give you access to games and to be able to organise them seamlessly Fanfolium charges a certain
                        amount of fee. The entry fees for any contest includes those fees.
                        The entry amount collected by users at the joining of contests isn’t taken up by Fanfolium. We
                        earn no immediate interests on that. Only after distributing the prizes of the winners do we
                        take our platform fee.
                        Users are free to withdraw any unused amount that they have deposited with Fanfolium to be able
                        to access multiple games. They are also free to withdraw any amount that they get as winners of
                        contests, after the mandatory tax deductions.
                        Sometimes, Fanfolium will provide bonus amounts to encourage contestants to participate. Those
                        amounts are not withdrawable and can be utilised only on the platform while playing games within
                        a definite time period as provided by Fanfolium.
                        Any request for payouts will be completed only after a background checkup of authenticity(
                        Pan/Adhar/ Bank account/ Identity). The payout processes often go through a banking procedure
                        which may take from one to several working days on certain occasions. We do not guarantee
                        immediate payout but we do ensure a payout if the user’s authenticity is established and the
                        banking procedures have been duly completed.
                        Fanfolium provides two categories of accounts for processing and reconciliation of payments: (i)
                        ‘Credits’ Account, (ii) ‘Winnings’ Account. We do not allow a transfer of any amounts in the
                        user's accounts to any other category of account held by the user or any third party account,
                        including a bank account held by a third party.
                        User's winnings in any Pool will reflect as credits to the User's Winnings Account.
                        User’s remitting the amount through designated payment gateway shall be credited to the user's
                        Credit Account.
                        Each time a user participates in any game on Fanfolium, the pre-designated amount shall be
                        debited in the user’s account. This amount will be debited primarily from User’s ‘Credits’
                        Account and thereafter, if there is still an amount of participation fee due, it shall be
                        debited from the User’s Winning Account.
                        In case there is still a due amount in relation to the user’s participation in any
                        Pool(s)/game(s), the user will be taken to the designated payment gateway to initiate such
